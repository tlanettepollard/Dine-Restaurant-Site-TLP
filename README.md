## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View the current time and location information based on their IP address
- View additional information about the date and time in the expanded state
- Be shown the correct greeting and background image based on the time of day they're visiting the site
- Generate random programming quotes by clicking the refresh icon near the quote

I have included two screen shots of four devices: 
* iPhone 6/7/8 (375x667)
* iPad (768x1024)
* Laptop (1280x950)

I used an awesome open-source devtool app called [Responsively](https://opencollective.com/responsively). It allowed me to see the calculator on different sized devices live while I was editing. You can inspect the code and take screen shots.  I also used the [Photoscape app](http://www.photoscape.org/ps/main/index.php). It's a free photo editing app (you can pay for extras). I was able to combine screenshots of each area of my Dine webpages and resize the final photo.
